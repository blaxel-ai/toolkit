## bl delete

Delete a resource

### Synopsis

Delete Blaxel resources from your workspace.

WARNING: Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Resources are immediately
deactivated and removed along with their configurations.

Two deletion modes:
1. By name: Use subcommands like 'bl delete agent my-agent'
2. By file: Use 'bl delete -f resource.yaml' for declarative management

What Happens:
- Resource is immediately stopped and deactivated
- Configuration and metadata are removed
- Associated logs and metrics may be retained (check workspace policy)
- Data volumes are NOT automatically deleted (use 'bl delete volume')

Before Deleting:
- Backup any important configuration or data
- Check dependencies (other resources using this one)
- Consider stopping instead of deleting for temporary disablement

Note: Deleting an agent/job stops it immediately but may not delete associated
storage volumes. Use 'bl get volumes' to see persistent storage and delete
separately if needed.

```
bl delete [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # Delete by name (using subcommands)
  bl delete agent my-agent
  bl delete job my-job
  bl delete sandbox my-sandbox

  # Delete from YAML file
  bl delete -f my-resource.yaml

  # Delete multiple resources from directory
  bl delete -f ./resources/ -R

  # Delete from stdin (useful in pipelines)
  cat resource.yaml | bl delete -f -

  # Safe deletion workflow
  bl get agent my-agent    # Review resource first
  bl delete agent my-agent # Delete after confirmation
```

### Options
