## bl workspaces

List all workspaces with the current workspace highlighted, set optionally a new current workspace

### Synopsis

List and manage Blaxel workspaces.

A workspace is an isolated environment within Blaxel that contains your
resources (agents, jobs, models, sandboxes, etc.). Workspaces provide:

- Isolation between projects or environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Separate billing and resource quotas
- Team collaboration boundaries
- Independent access control and permissions

The current workspace (marked with *) determines where commands operate.
All commands like 'bl deploy', 'bl get', 'bl run' use the current workspace
unless you override with the --workspace flag.

To switch workspaces, provide the workspace name as an argument.
To list all authenticated workspaces, run without arguments.

```
bl workspaces [workspace] [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # List all authenticated workspaces
  bl workspaces

  # Switch to different workspace
  bl workspaces production

  # Use specific workspace for one command (doesn't switch current)
  bl get agents --workspace staging

  # Get only the current workspace name
  bl workspaces --current

  # Common multi-workspace workflow
  bl workspaces dev        # Switch to dev
  bl deploy                # Deploy to dev
  bl workspaces prod       # Switch to prod
  bl deploy                # Deploy to prod
```
