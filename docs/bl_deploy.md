### Synopsis

  -e, --env-file strings   Environment file to load (default [.env])
  -h, --help               help for deploy

  -s, --secrets strings    Secrets to deploy
      --skip-build         Skip the build step
```

### Interactive Mode

The `--interactive` flag enables a Terminal User Interface (TUI) that provides real-time visibility into the deployment process:

- **Live Status Updates**: See the current status of each resource being deployed (Pending, Uploading, Building, Deploying, Complete, Failed)
- **Build Logs**: For resources with `x-blaxel-auto-generated` label, view live build logs as the container image is being built
- **Navigation**: Use arrow keys (↑/↓) to navigate between resources, 'l' to toggle log visibility, 'q' to quit
- **Concurrent Deployment**: Resources are deployed in parallel when possible

Example usage:
```bash
# Interactive deployment with real-time status
bl deploy --interactive

# Test interactive mode without actual deployment
bl deploy --interactive --mock
```
